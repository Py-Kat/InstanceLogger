# [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com) Instance Tracker!
This is for the **VRChat 
players** who constantly find themselves 
re-joining the same instances they've 
already visited!

## General Description:
This script is basically just 
a simple **terminal UI based** 
text logger that will check 
every new input against previously 
logged ones, and deny if 
already logged. **There used to 
be an in-game mod for 
this!** But since those are 
far gone I've chosen to 
create this alternative for myself 
and others who may experience 
the same!

This script of course can 
also be used for other 
text logging / checking needs! This 
was just my original idea 
behind the creation.

### Future Plans:
- Blacklisting
- Better Checking Against Logs
- Overall Enhancements
- MAYBE an actual UI

## Final Note:
If you experience any **issues**, 
or have any **suggestions** I'd 
love to hear them! I 
am new to programming so 
**criticism is appreciated**!
